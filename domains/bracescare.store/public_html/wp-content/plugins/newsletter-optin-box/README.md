## Workflow

The `master` branch is the development branch which means it contains the next version to be released. `stable` contains the current latest release and `stable-dev` contains the corresponding stable development version. Always open up PRs against `master`.

## Release instructions

1. **Merge changes:** Merge all changes into `master` and ensure that [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/hizzle-co/noptin) does not produce any fatal errors.
2. **Version bump:** Bump the version numbers in `noptin.php` and `readme.txt` if it does not already reflect the version being released.
3. **Update Changelog:** Update the changelog in `readme.txt`
4. **Localize:** Update the language files.
5. **Clean:** Check to be sure any new files/paths that are unnecessary in the production version are included in `.gitattributes`.
6. **Merge into stable:** Make a non-fast-forward merge from `master` into `stable`. `stable` contains the latest stable version.
9. **Test:** Check out the `stable` branch and test for functionality locally.
10. **Release on GitHub:** Create a new GitHub release and copy the changelog for the release into the Release body. Create a tag for the release as `X.Y.Z` then publish the release. Users will now be able to update the plugin from their WordPress dashboards.

**NOTE:** After each release, merge the `stable` branch into the `stable-dev` branch. Urgent fixes will go into the `stable-dev` branch and released ASAP.


## Support Level

**Active:** Noptin is actively working on this, and we expect to continue work for the foreseeable future including keeping tested up to the most recent version of WordPress.  Bug reports, feature requests, questions, and pull requests are welcome.
